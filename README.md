# PREDICTION ON HOSPITAL READMISSION OF DIABETES PATIENTS
*[Marie NAVARRO]*

*[IRONHACK Bootcamp DATA ANALYSE August 2020]*


## Project Final Week 9 - Statistical Analysis Project
In this repository, there are : 
- the dataset I worked on (.csv files) and its description (.txt file)
- my Python code (.ipynb files)
- the final presentation (.pptx file)


## Project Description
Using all advanced python ressources we learnt during this bootcamp, I worked on a dataset about hospitalisation of diabetics
people in order to build a predictive model on readmissions using supervised machine learning algorithms (classification).


## Process
File n°2 :
* Data cleaning, removing missing and useless values
* Data manipulation, managing caterorical features
File n°4 :
* Features selection + clustering eliminated features
* Model building on selected features + previous clusters
* Model evaluation
